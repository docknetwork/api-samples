# Dock API sample apps & scripts

## Setup

Create a `.env` file with the following values:
```
API_KEY=<INSERT YOUR KEY HERE>
ISSUER_DID=did:dock:myissuerdid
RECIPIENT_DID=did:key:walletholderrecipient
API_URL=https://api-testnet.dock.io
```

For some examples you may need to register an issuer DID, [view the documentation](https://docs.api.dock.io/#create-did).

`RECIPIENT_DID` typically will be a DID from a wallet application
